      								  <p>If you are worried about sensitive data on your computer, then here are some simple steps to protect your data.</p>
                                      <div>
                                      <ol>
                                      	<li>Always keep a backup copy of your sensitive data. All hardware will fail at some point, so backup your data to a secure location such as another computer, external hard drive, or online backup service.</li>
                                        <li>In some cases it may be appropriate to schedule an onsite appointment, so that you work one on one with a technician and monitor the repair in realtime.</li>
                                        <li>Also if possible, you can move any confidential data off of the machine that needs service onto another machine or external hard drive.</li>
                                        <li>If you have highly sensitive or private data on your computer, then please notify the technician servicing your machine of any special request on how to handle the data.</li>
                                        <li>At Digital Crisis we have never lost anyones data. If your computer is ever at risk of data loss, then our computer specialists will immediately make a cloned image of your hard drive and store it on our secure file servers.</li>
