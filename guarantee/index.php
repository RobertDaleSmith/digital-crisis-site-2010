                                      Once the system has been fully diagnosed and the client gives approval for repair, all problems reported by the client will be fixed and the computer will be in working order when returned to the client. Digital Crisis 
                                      will remove all computer viruses and malware infections, if virus clean up is approved by the client. If an operating system reload is required, then we guarantee that all the hardware drivers will be installed correctly, all OS updates will be installed, user data will be migrated correctly, and any softwares you dropped off with the machine will be reinstalled. </p>

                                      <p>
                                      All of our parts come with a one year warranty, unless stated otherwise. Some repairs require unique parts that can only be found as used and not new. In these situations the vendor dictates the warranty period. If used parts are required for repair, then we will always inform the client so that they make the right repair decision.
