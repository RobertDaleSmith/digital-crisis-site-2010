                  <p>The tool for the 21st century, many people put their entire lives on their computers. The sheer amount of data that can build up over the years can make it a headache to properly make the move from one machine to another when it's time to upgrade.</p>
                   
                  <p>Digital Crisis of Houston makes this process easy with our Data Migration service, moving your data from your old computer to your new one for you, including the proper migration and importing of your sensitive documents, pictures, music and emails.</p>
                   
                  <p>If you've recently reinstalled your Windows operating system we can restore your files easily for you, so your machine is as familiar as it was before. Lost your data or accidently deleted some files? Just because the file is gone from the recycle bin, doesn't mean it has been permanently deleted.</p>
                   
                  <p>Digital Crisis uses advanced techniques and hardware to recover your lost or deleted files, even from a failing hard drive. We can recover data from a broad range of devices, including Desktops, Laptops, MP3 players, digital cameras and flash drives.</p>
                   
                  <p>Haven't lost any files yet? Preparing for that possibility is incredibly easy and stress-free with our local and online data backup solutions. For someone needing to backup their entire hard drive to a secondary external drive or put the entire contents on CD/DVD discs, we can do that for you easily and at a price that's easy on you. Backing up your vital information is something no business should do without, that's why Digital Crisis also caters to public and private operations of all sizes.</p>
                   
                  <p>What would happen if the unthinkable occurred? Businesses can lose terabytes of data in freak fires, floods and power outages, if this happened would you be able to resume work the next day?

Digital Crisis can even perform clean room data recovery in Houston and offers FREE site consultations for evaluating your backup configuration and gives you the best solution for your place of business.</p>
                   
                  <p>If you are not looking to back up or to recover any files and instead need do the opposite, Digital Crisis can perform a U.S. Department of Defense level secure deletion of your entire hard drive, making sure your old computer or external drive isn't storing personal and private information that someone else can access. This is especially useful for those wishing to sell their computers, as it will delete any latent credit card information or private documents for good.</p>
