                <p>We know you love your Mac, and Digital Crisis is the leading Houston company to offer world class support for Mac Computers, and we don't take that responsibility lightly. Digital Crisis of Houston not only specializes in general maintenance, optimization and upgrades, we offer more by also providing data recovery services, screen replacements and even complete disaster planning for your Apple-powered business in the event of a fire or flood, allowing you to work off of our remote servers until your business is up and running again.</p>
                 
                <p>Thinking about transferring to a Mac from a PC or vice versa? Want to set up your Mac to work with Parallels or as a Virtual Machine so that you can run Microsoft Windows?  We can help you. We have the tools and resources to make such transitions as seamless and smooth as possible, even offering data recovery, backup and migration services for Apple's iTunes, as well as setup, repair and data recovery for your favorite iOS devices.</p>
                 
                <p>Did you know that if your Mac is out of warranty, Apple refuses to repair it? Instead, Apple will offer to sell you a brand new Mac. We here at Digital Crisis believe that's bad business, and know that many times fully replacing a burned-out Mac is unnecessary, not to mention costly. Because of this Digital Crisis will repair ANY Mac brought to us, whether it is under warranty or not. Plus, our technicians are specially trained to service both PC and Mac and are trained how to work with integrated PCs and Macs in network environments, which can be especially vital to businesses.</p>
                 
                <p>With Digital Crisis, you will not have to worry about two IT service companies when it comes to keeping your Mac or PC operating like a well-tuned machine. We offer a flat rate pricing for Mac/Apple repairs done at our facilities to give you the peace of mind when it comes to repairing your Apple computer.</p>
                  
                <p>Have a busy schedule? Can't make it to our shop? No problem, Digital Crisis will pick up and deliver your Mac from your work or home, at no charge! So, whether it is setting up a brand new Mac, or just for repairs, Digital Crisis is there. We provide the complete and comprehensive coverage your Mac deserves. Call today and make arrangements for one of our Houston area Mac specialists to get your Apple running in top notch condition.</p>
